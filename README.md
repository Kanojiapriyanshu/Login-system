## Features

- Responsive design with a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Login form with email and password validation.
- Seamless navigation using React Router.
- Backend integration for authentication using Axios.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A running backend server for authentication (e.g., Express.js with the endpoint `http://localhost:5000/api/login`)
